The report is avalible in the report branch and is called report.md. The results from our coverage tool (both before and after we added tests to improve coverage) are avalible in the coverage-report folder. Files called <function name>.report contain all of the logs generated while running the tests, files called <function name>.reportparsedold contain a parsed version of the reports before our added coverage and <function name>.reportparsed contains a parsed version of the reports after our added coverage. 

The added tests are exists in the test branch. The report should contain links to all of the git test commits. Our added Coverage class is located in the file coverage.py in the lib/matplotlib folder and to parse a report file you run the parser.py file with the report path as an argument.
